# Fuzzy Record Matching
Project done as part of an internship at CEMEX sales department.

Given several categories (String similarity, numbers within string, brand, units, product code), a set for each was made, weighted as specified by the user, and combined, to give a rating of match likelihood for the best candidates among the items in the reference catalog.
